<p>
  The rules for edge creation can be customized by implementing the <code>IPortCandidateProvider</code> interface.
</p>
<p>
  Add the custom implementation as decoration to the edge decorator of the graph to use it.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Initiate edge creation by dragging from an unselected node (with the left mouse button pressed).
    Releasing the button finishes edge creation if the mouse is on a valid target and creates a bend otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Node Types
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#b22222"><b>Red nodes</b></font> cannot have any edges. You cannot start or end an edge at
    them. A red port candidate highlights that these nodes are invalid targets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only edges from other <font color="#228b22"><b>green nodes</b></font> can end at green nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#4169e1"><b>Blue nodes</b></font> provide a set of predefined ports. Only one edge can be connected
    to each of these ports. Occupied ports are highlighted in red.
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ff8c00"><b>Orange nodes</b></font> provide dynamic port candidates. Edges can start and end anywhere inside
    these nodes when the <code>Shift</code> key is pressed. Note that these candidates are not highlighted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edges to <font color="purple"><b>purple nodes</b></font> can only end at ports of the same color as the source
    port or the source node.
  </li>
</ul>
