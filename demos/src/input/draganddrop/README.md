# Drag and Drop
  

 The demo shows how to combine arbitrary components with a GraphControl in yFiles for JavaFX, specifically, how to perform drag operations from a `ListView` into a GraphControl using the build-in drag and drop support.   

 This feature allows you to provide a palette of nodes, labels and ports with different styles. Thereby, the user can interactively create and extend complex diagrams.
