# Neo4j Demo
 The following instructions describe how to set up the Neo4j Demo. 

## Setup Neo4j data base
 If you already have a Neo4j data base with an example graph running, you can skip this step. 

 Otherwise you can install [Neo4j for Java](https://neo4j.com/download/) and follow its `Getting started` to create an example graph.   

## Setup the Neo4j demo
    
*  Start your favorite IDE.   
*  Create a new Gradle project using the `build.gradle` file in `demos/src-neo4j/integration/neo4j` .   
*  Let your IDE create a gradle wrapper for the project.     

## Run the demo
    
*  Make sure your Neo4j Browser is running.   
*  Execute the `run` Gradle task.   
*  Enter the requested `URL` , `user name` and `password` of your Neo4j Browser.   
*  Explore your graph and have a look at the `Things to Try` .
